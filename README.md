You need a computer running Mac OS 10.10 (or a later version) as well as an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch running iOS 9 (or a later version).

On your computer, you need to install Apple's standard tools for iOS developers. These include Xcode, iOS SDK, and the Xcode Command Line Tools. You also need to set up OpenCV 3.1 (or a later version). All this software is free, and Chapter 1, Setting Up Software and Hardware, provides setup instructions.

This book is great for developers who are new to iOS, computer vision, or both.
Previous experience with Objective-C or C++ is recommended.
